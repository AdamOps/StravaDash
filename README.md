This is a work in progress for an app that fetches Strava athlete/activity data and lets the user do cool things with it.
Basic intended features to add:
- Progress charts on best efforts for chosen distances
- Equipment usage (e.g. shoe mileage) over time

More advanced features
- Auto-classify runs based on activity data. E.g., recognise interval runs, tempo runs, or long runs based on surrounding user activity or data variability.
- Predict race times based on recent exercise performance (e.g. using some sort of MA model)
